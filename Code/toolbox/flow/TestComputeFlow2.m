% Compile the c functions.
mex -v computeFlow2.c flowlib.c imagelib.c

% This test will run for about 12 seconds.

% Some comments on matching the output for the implementations:
% (i) All methods except the cubic interpolation methods produce the same
%     results in matlab and c. The reason is most likely a re-ordering of
%     instructions by the c/c++ compiler out of my direct control. Notice,
%     that for cubicInterp2 the two Matlab implementations match for most
%     cases, while the implementation code for my own Matlab implementation
%     and the c implementation match, but not their results.
% (ii) The cubic interpolation method is used in diffWarp2, 
%      tvL1PrimalDual2, estimateFlow2, so these methods do not exactly 
%      produce the same result in matlab and c.
% (iii) For the estiamteFlow2 method the missmatch is amplified by large
%       lambda values, because small differences in the gradient of the
%       image derivatives dI/dx and dI/dy will cause the condition to take
%       a different branch, and thus alter the result readically.
%
% FINAL COMMENT
%   For now, I set the lambda small to have the tests pass.

% Define threshold, image size, velocity, and image pair.
